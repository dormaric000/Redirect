# What is this?
This is a website base to jumpscare your friends! Just customise the jumpscare and make a website from it using GitHub's pages feature!
See an example here: https://dormaric000.github.io/Redirect/

# How do I jumpscare my friends
It's simple! Just follow these steps.

## Creating the repository
1. Click 'Use this template' > 'Create a new repository'
2. Fill in all the fields marked with a *. (name, owner, template, etc...)
3. Make the repository PUBLIC. Making it private won't allow you to use GitHub Pages
4. Create the repository

## Uploading the jumpscare
1. Go to the Sources folder
2. Upload a video (Note: Video must be named "Video.mp4" and have the .mp4 format)

## Making it a webpage
1. Click settings at the top
2. Click pages on the left
3. Under Branch click on 'None' and then 'main'
4. Click 'Save'
